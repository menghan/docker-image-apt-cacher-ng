This is a simple [Apt-Cacher-NG][1] service, for use as a Debian/Ubuntu
package caching proxy.  It is intended to be used in a trusted environment,
such as within a LAN behind a firewall, as it does not use any access control
or save any logs.

This image is built on [extellisys/debian-wheezy][2], and all additional
layers have been squashed into a single image.  Installation, usage, and
build documentation is available on the [GitHub project page][3].
